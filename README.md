# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction

## Overview
This repository focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete mixes using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used provides detailed information on various components' proportions used in the mix, along with the compressive strength measurement.

## Dataset
- **Description:** The dataset contains attributes such as cement, slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age of the concrete mix in days.
- **Source:** [Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/concrete-compressive-strength-data-set/)
- **File:** `concrete_data.csv`

## Algorithms Used
This project employs the following machine learning algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
